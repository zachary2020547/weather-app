This project is based on Aaron's project located at https://github.com/aar9nk/genxi-jwd-weather-app - in which to practice JavaScript, HTML, CSS and APIs.

What I have learnt from this project:

-I'm still having difficulties with the application of the concepts into practice
Solution: More practice and I will have access to the internet to look up concepts/troubleshoot

-It is difficult to remember about HTML, JavaScript and CSS 
Solution: If I can look up the topics and an example in which I could confirm if the item would work. Also using console.log to test my work.

-Will have to change or remove my API keys 
Solution: I recieved an email from GitGuardian alerting me that a token was exposed within my GitHub account. I took action upon recieving that email but it is something that I will need to keep in mind.

Review:
-I didn't use CSS as much as I was expecting, although there isn't much content. If I had more time or wanted to refine the webpage, I would work on the CSS file.
-Using comments or "commenting out what I would do" at the start of the project. I didn't do this - I just followed along the instructions however this is something that I will be looking to implement in the future.
